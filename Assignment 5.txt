1) why docker?

* Developers can create containers without Docker, but the platform makes it easier, simpler, and safer to build, deploy and manage containers.
* Docker is essentially a toolkit that enables developers to build, deploy, run, update, and stop containers using simple commands 
  and work-saving automation through a single API

2)why this tool is named as docker?

* Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. 
* Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infrastructure so you can deliver software quickly. 
* With Docker, you can manage your infrastructure in the same ways you manage your applications.

3) what is an image?

* A Docker image is a file used to execute code in a Docker container. 
* Docker images act as a set of instructions to build a Docker container, like a template. ... 
* A Docker image contains application code, libraries, tools, dependencies and other files needed to make an application run.

4) what is container in docker?
 * A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably 
 * from one computing environment to another. ... 
 * Secure: Applications are safer in containers and Docker provides the strongest default isolation capabilities in the industry.

5) why do we need to write a Docker file?

* However, writing a Dockerfile is a more consistent and repeatable way to build your own images. 
* A Dockerfile is a text file that has a series of instructions on how to build your image. 
* It supports a simple set of commands that you need to use in your Dockerfile.

6) what is docker registry?

* A registry is a storage and content delivery system, holding named Docker images, available in different tagged versions.... 
* Users interact with a registry by using docker push and pull commands.
* Example: docker pull registry-1.docker.io/distribution/registry:2.1 . Storage itself is delegated to drivers.
