1)what is IP address?

* An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. 
* IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.

2)How many types of ip are there?

* There are 4 types of ip:
* An internet protocol (IP) address allows computers to send and receive information. 
* There are four types of IP addresses: public, private, static, and dynamic.

3)public and private IP addresses?

* A public IP address identifies you to the wider internet so that all the information you're searching for can find you. 
* A private IP address is used within a private network to connect securely to other devices within that same network. 
* Each device within the same network has a unique private IP address.

4) IPV4 and IPV6 difference?

* The main difference between IPv4 and IPv6 is the address size of IP addresses. 
* The IPv4 is a 32-bit address, whereas IPv6 is a 128-bit hexadecimal address. 
* IPv6 provides a large address space, and it contains a simple header as compared to IPv4.

5) What is backend pool?

* The backend pool is a critical component of the load balancer.
* The backend pool defines the group of resources that will serve traffic for a given load-balancing rule. 
* There are two ways of configuring a backend pool: ... Combination of IP address and Virtual Network (VNET) Resource ID.

6) what is a frontend ip address?

* Presents a routable IP address representing a set of application servers to application clients. ... 
* Routes packets from the clients that establish new transport connections to a selected application server. 
* Routes packets in existing transport connections to the correct server for the connection.

7) what is health probes?

* The configuration of the health probe and probe responses determine which backend pool instances will receive new flows. 
* You can use health probes to detect the failure of an application on a backend endpoint. ... 
* When a health probe fails, Load Balancer will stop sending new flows to the respective unhealthy instance.

8) what is vnet?

* An Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a representation of your own network in the cloud. 
* It is a logical isolation of the Azure cloud dedicated to your subscription. ... 
* When you create a VNet, your services and VMs within your VNet can communicate directly and securely with each other in the cloud.

9) what are different regions you have in azure?

* Azure is generally available in 52 regions around the world, with plans announced for 6 additional regions.
* Geograhic expansion is a priority for azure because it enables our customers to achieve higher performance an it support their reguirements and 
  preference regarding data location.

10) what is availability set in azure?

* An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application 
  is built to provide for redundancy and availability. 
* We recommended that two or more VMs are created within an availability set to provide for a 
  highly available application and to meet the 99.95% Azure SLA.

11) what is availability zone?

* Availability Zones are unique physical locations within an Azure region.
* Each zone is made up of one or more datacenters equipped with independent power, cooling, and networking. ... 
* With Availability Zones, Azure offers industry best 99.99% VM uptime SLA.09

12) How to add VMS to availability set?

* You can't add an existing VM to an availability set after it's created. 
* When you create a VM with New-AzVM, you use the -AvailabilitySetName parameter to specify the name of the availability set.
* Now create two VMs with New-AzVM in the availability set.
* It takes a few minutes to create and configure both VMs.

13) what is horizontal scaling and vertical scaling?

* Horizontal is more flexible in a cloud situation as it allows you to run potentially thousands of VMs to handle load. 
* In contrast, vertical scaling is different. 
* It keeps the same number of VMs, but makes the VMs more ("up") or less ("down") powerful. ... 
* Vertical scaling also usually requires a VM to stop and restart.
