1) What is insights in azure?

* It is an extensible Application Performance Management (APM) service for developers and DevOps professionals. 
* Use it to monitor your live applications and It can monitor and analyze telemetry from mobile apps by integrating with Visual Studio App Center.

2) what is load balancer in azure?

* An Azure load balancer is a Layer-4 (TCP, UDP) load balancer that provides high availability by distributing incoming traffic among healthy VMs.
* A load balancer health probe monitors a given port on each VM and only distributes traffic to an operational VM.
* The backend pool instances can be Azure Virtual Machines or instances in a virtual machine scale set.

3) What is availability zone?

* Availability zones (AZs) are isolated locations within data center regions from which public cloud services originate and operate. 
* Regions are geographic locations in which public cloud service providers' data centers reside...
* Admins can move resources to another availability zone in the event of an outage.
* Each zone in a region has redundant and separate power, networking and connectivity to reduce the likelihood of two zones failing simultaneously. 
* A common misconception is that a single zone equals a single data center.

4) What is availability set in azure?

* An availability set is a logical grouping of VMs that allows Azure to understand how your application 
  is built to provide for redundancy and availability. 
* We recommended that two or more VMs are created within an availability set to provide for a highly available 
  application and to meet the 99.95% Azure SLA.

5) what is load balancer?

* Load balancing is defined as the methodical and efficient distribution of network or application traffic across multiple servers in a server farm.
* Each load balancer sits between client devices and backend servers, receiving and then distributing incoming requests
* to any available server capable of fulfilling them.

6) What is VMSS?

* Azure virtual machine scale sets let you create and manage a group of load balanced VMs. 
* The number of VM instances can automatically increase or decrease in response to demand or a defined schedule.
